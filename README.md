**Project Title: Job Scraping from TimesJobs**

## Overview

This project is a Python-based web scraping tool that allows users to search for job postings on the TimesJobs website based on specified skill sets. It uses the `requests` library to fetch the HTML content of the website and `BeautifulSoup` (with the `lxml` parser) to parse and extract relevant job information. The extracted job details, including company names, pay information (if available), and more, are saved in individual text files for easy access and review.

## How to Use

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system (Python 3.x recommended) along with the required libraries: `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `lxml`.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

3. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required dependencies using pip by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4 lxml
   ```

4. **Run the Program**: Execute the Python script `job_scraper.py`.

5. **Enter Skills**: The program will prompt you to enter two skill sets separated by a space. For example, you can input "Python Django" or "Java Spring."

6. **Wait for Results**: The program will search for job postings on TimesJobs based on the provided skills. The matched job details will be stored in individual text files within the "Posts" directory.

## Usage Tips

- The program is set to run in an infinite loop and will keep searching for job postings every 0.1 minutes (configurable). To stop the program, press `Ctrl+C`.

- Ensure that you are adhering to TimesJobs' terms of service while using the scraper. Be respectful of their website's resources and considerate of their data usage policies.
